For my first Personal Projects, I used the same dataset to explore predictive modeling and data visualization. 
First, I used seaborn to create visualizations and find patterns in the data before creating a Linear Regression model that could predict life expectancies. 
Next, I decided to explore Tableau and visualize this data with maps and charts.
